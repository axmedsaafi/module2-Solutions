		<h1 class="c">responsive</h1>
		<p>A fully responsive website will rescale itself to preserve the user experience and look and feel across all devices â€” with no irritating zooming, scrolling or resizing. These days web users crave consistency and an elegant User Experience (UX), and they'll eject if your site isn't fully responsive.</p>
